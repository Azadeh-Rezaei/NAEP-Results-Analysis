# NAEP-Results-Analysis
Analyzing the results of NAEP Mathematics and Reading Assessments in the US

### Objective
To build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python


### Data
This set is retrieved from an external data source. I initially found this set on Kaggle through this link. I checked the data for the assessment scores on the NCES independent website. This data is publicly available and is trustworthy because it comes from a government open data portal. I have also sourced other data from the US Census Bureau and other NCES assessment score data that I might use later if needed to build up on this project. 
Data Collection: 
I am initially going to use one dataset that is the extension of multiple datasets provided on [Kaggle here labeled “states_all_extended"](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project?select=states_all_extended.csv)

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Different parts of this set are sourced by different agencies and combined in the main file I will be using:

Most of the data is sourced by the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)
The enrollment data is collected from the National Center for [Education Statistics (NCES) official website](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/stnfis.asp)



The financial data/revenue is collected from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/school-finances/data/tables.html)

The academic achievement and assessment scores are collected based on [the Nation’s Report Card](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ndecore/xplore/NDE)
