# NAEP-Results-Analysis
Analyzing the results of NAEP Mathematics and Reading Assessments in the US

### Objective
To build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python


### Data
This set is retrieved from an external data source. I initially found this set on Kaggle through this link. I checked the data for the assessment scores on the NCES independent website. This data is publicly available and is trustworthy because it comes from a government open data portal. I have also sourced other data from the US Census Bureau and other NCES assessment score data that I might use later if needed to build up on this project. 
Data Collection: 

> I am initially going to use one dataset that is the extension of multiple datasets provided on [Kaggle here labeled “states_all_extended"](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project?select=states_all_extended.csv)

Different parts of this set are sourced by different agencies and combined in the main file I will be using. Most of the data is sourced by the U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES):

> The enrollment data is collected from the National Center for [Education Statistics (NCES) official website](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/stnfis.asp)

> The financial data/revenue is collected from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/school-finances/data/tables.html)

> The academic achievement and assessment scores are collected based on [the Nation’s Report Card](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ndecore/xplore/NDE)


### Key Questions

-	Does the federal/state and local revenue correlate with the scores in grades 4 and 8 NAEP Assessments?

-	Is there a correlation between federal/state/local revenue and instruction expenditure and is there a correlation between instruction expenditure and average NAEP assessment scores?

-	The information on different demographics is limited but most of the data is from the recent years so I’d like to look for correlations between scores and different demographics as well. 

-	The data for the NAEP assessments was last recorded in 2019 and before the pandemic so I am very interested in coming back to this project in a year or two and include the assessment scores for the NAEP testing after the pandemic with the prediction of what we thought/forecasted the scores to be at in each state.
